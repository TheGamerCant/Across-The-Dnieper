	- Successful assassination by the SBU's 'Fifth Directorate' on 16 October 2016 when a bomb went off in a lift / elevator as he entered it. Pavlov and his bodyguard died as a result.
	
Alexander 'Batman' Bednov:
	- Killed by LNR on 1 January 2015 by forces loyal to Plotnitsky, head of the LNR. Likely approved of directly by the Kremlin
	
Aleksey Mozgovoy:
	- Attempted assassination in March 2015 (Can't find source for exact date), car was blown up while on the  Alchevsk-Luhansk highway outside of Mikhailovka. Mozgovoy excaped with minor injuries
	- Killed 23 May 2015 in almost the exact same location as the previous attempt. This time his car was blown up and shot at (Unsure whether killed by explosion or gunfire. Also unsure whether previous attempt included gunfire, likely not as any mention omits such a claim). Mozgovoy, press secretary Anna Samelyuk, a driver, and six bodyguards were killed. Likely culprits were Russian forces 
	
Yevgeny Zhilin:
	- Killed in a restaurant alongside assossiate Andrei Kozyrev in Moscow on 20 September 2016. Moscow claims it was part of a 'business dispute', while Kyiv claims it was orchestrated by Russia to tie up loose ends, as it were. As the assassin has not been caught yet to the best of my knowledge, that points to it likely being a Russian job
