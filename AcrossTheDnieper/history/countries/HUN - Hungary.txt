	desc = "Viktor Orbán was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. He grew up in a family of Protestant intellectuals and attended the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where he studied law.

	In 1988, Orbán co-founded the Fidesz party, which began as a liberal youth movement but eventually shifted to the right and became a center-right party. He was elected to parliament in 1990 and served as the leader of the opposition from 1993 to 1998.

	In 1998, Orbán became the Prime Minister of Hungary at the age of 35, making him the youngest person to hold the office in Hungarian history. During his first term in office, he implemented a number of economic and political reforms, including tax cuts and privatization measures, which helped to boost the Hungarian economy.

	In 2002, Orbán's government was defeated in a general election, and he spent the next eight years in opposition. In 2010, he was elected Prime Minister again, and his government implemented a number of controversial measures, including a new constitution that has been criticized for limiting civil liberties and weakening the judiciary.

	Orbán's government has also been accused of limiting press freedom and cracking down on political opponents. However, he remains popular among many Hungarians, who credit him with restoring national pride and strengthening the country's economy.

	In the 2014 scenario of Hearts of Iron IV, Viktor Orbán would likely be the leader of the Hungarian nation, representing the center-right Fidesz party. As the leader of Hungary, he would likely focus on strengthening the country's economy and national security, while also promoting traditional Hungarian values and culture. His government may be criticized for its controversial policies, but he would likely enjoy strong support from his base of supporters in Hungary."

In the 1980s and 1990s, Győrkös often clashed with the authorities due to crimes and joining a criminal organization. In the 2000s, Győrkös founded the organization Magyar Gárda Mozgalom, whose purpose was to defend Hungarian Christian values. In the 2000s, Győrkös gave many speeches, often with racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic content, and played an important role in the Jobbik party.
