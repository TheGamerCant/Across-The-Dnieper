 russia.1000.desc:0 "З завершенням приготувань офіційно розпочалася зимова Олімпіада в Сочі. Спортсмени з усього світу зібралися, щоб позмагатися у різноманітних зимових видах спорту, в той час як глядачі насолоджуються святкуваннями та вболівають за своїх улюблених атлетів. Російська влада не пожалкувала грошей, щоб зробити цю подію незабутньою, з найсучаснішими спорудами і жвавою атмосферою, ці ігри є найдорожчими в історії Олімпійських ігор.\n\nЦя подія також є шансом показати себе світові з найкращого боку, в той час як Путін з посмішкою на обличчі особисто відвідує Олімпіаду."

Сьогоднішня подія для нього особлива - хокей. Це його улюблений вид спорту, і, як відомо, Путін практикує свої навички майже щодня, а також раніше грав перед камерами."

 russia.1005.desc:0 "Під час зимової Олімпіади президент Путін зустрівся зі своїми радниками, щоб обговорити ситуацію в Києві. Якщо коротко, то справи йдуть не дуже добре.\n\nПутін витратив роки на просування прокремлівських політиків на ключові посади в Україні, включно з президентом, і, схоже, все пішло шкереберть. Протестувальники, які виступали проти Януковича, переважають настільки, що ФСБ переконана, що Янукович вже планує свою втечу. У зв'язку з цим Путін наказав розробити плани на випадок можливого втручання ФСБ, щоб забезпечити російські інтереси в регіоні на випадок найгіршого розвитку подій."

 russia.1007.desc:0 "Після нашого стрімкого захоплення Криму багато українських військ все ще перебувають на півострові. Президенту [SOV.GetLeader] було запропоновано два варіанти: Перший - дозволити їм повернутися в Україну, що покаже нас у хорошому світлі і створить враження, що ми не бажаємо шкоди їхньому народу. Другий - поводитися з ними так, як ми поводимося з ворожими солдатами, і вимагати, щоб вони або здалися нам, або були знищені."

 russia.1008.desc:0 "В ході референдуму мешканці Криму висловили свою найнеочікуванішу думку - вони хочуть приєднатися до Росії. Результати підрахунку голосів показали, що понад 90% місцевого населення хоче покинути потопаючий український корабель та повернутися на свою історичну батьківщину.\n\nПо всій Росії проходять урочистості та мітинги, а на вустах людей звучать слова..."

 russia.1009.desc:0 "President Putin meet with Iranian officials earlier to discuss increasing co-operation with the regime in Tehran. On the surface, this was a diplomatic mission to improve ties between the two now sanctioned regimes, under the table the largest area of concern was for Russia to learn from Iran's economy.\n\nSince 1979, Iran has been a pariah to the west, and as such have become experts in getting around sanctions. Iran has agreed to let us in on their secrets, in exchange for increased trade, mostly of military gear to help put down any potential revolts or protests in their country.\n\nThe question is, what is the main field we want help in?"
 russia.1009.a:0 "We want help with our arms industry"
 russia.1009.b:0 "Civilian industries are the most important"

 russia.1010.t:0 "Revolt Against The West"
 russia.1010.desc:0 "As part of our government's ban on western food products as part of their so-called 'counter-sanctions' package, Russian state media has aired segments showing the destruction of western food products, whether it be via demolition, stamping or burning. More restrictions on what food can be imported into Russia from western countries are being discussed in the Duma, as the media celebrates these 'heroes' actions against the collective west."
 russia.1010.a:0 "Seems a bit much?"

 russia.1011.desc:0 "Every year, the president of the Russian Federation gives a speech, detailing the state of our nation. This year, however, is special.\n\nWe have welcomed new territories into our nation and are helping our brothers in Donbass resist their western government, but the year has not been all sunshine and rainbows. The west has launched co-ordinated attacks against us, and our economy has suffered greatly because of it.\n\nPresident Putin's speech is expected to be an important one, and as such, he focuses his attention towards..."

 russia.1012.desc:0 "Tragedy strikes the nation, as at 23:31 [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov was assassinated.\n\nAfter continuing to speak out against our operations in Ukraine, Boris Nemtsov had become convinced in his final days that Putin was out to kill him. He unfortunately may have been proven right, as he was shot seven or eight times while walking on Bolshoy Moskoretsky Bridge in Moscow. While our government has denied any involvement in the assassination, many of Nemtsov's colleagues and western analysts are suspicious of our claim, due to suspicious circumstances surrounding his death."

 russia.1013.desc:0 "Sergey Viktorovich Chemezov is a powerful oligarch within Russia, due to his status as CEO of Rostec. This gives him immense influence over our military industry, and makes him a possible king-maker for many factions within Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin has set up a meeting between the two men, in hopes of swaying Chemezov to his side - the question is, what does Putin offer him?"
 russia.1013.a:0 "Offer him some lucrative arms contracts"
 russia.1013.b:0 "Perhaps some diversification couldn't hurt?"
 russia.1013.c:0 "Give him a hand dealing with some mutual enemies"

 russia.1014.t:0 "Leaders Of Russia"
 russia.1014.desc:0 "Today marks a historic day for the Federation. The institute 'Leaders of Russia' has been given large sums of government funding, with more to come. This is noteworthy as it marks a shift away from the traditional power politics of Russia, instead seeking to take promising bureaucrats and teach them in the art of governance.\n\nUnsurprisingly, much of the political establishment are opposed to the institute, as they see it as a direct challenge to their power."
 russia.1014.a:0 "Za Bushchego!"

 russia.1015.t:0 "Patriots From A Young Age"
 russia.1015.desc:0 "After the attack on us from the collective west, many of Russia's young foolishly believed them to be in the right, and believing us to be the aggressor. To counter this, Putin and the Duma have signed into law a new curriculum, with special patriotic classes each week, called 'conversations about the important'. In these classes, we will teach the youth about what the motherland should mean to them, as well as give them the correct worldview on international affairs."
 russia.1015.a:0 "Papya knows best"

 russia.1016.t:0 "Philosophy Class"
 russia.1016.desc:0 "As part of the patriotic classes, our nation's best and brightest have been given the correct worldview on many current affairs, but there still remains some doubts in the mind of our youth. As such, schools are now to teach philosophy as part of these lessons, taking from the works of Solovyov, Gumilyov, and above all, Ilyin. These philosophers have been chosen as they teach our students about the greatness of Russia and her culture, as well as the need to expand Russia's borders for the good of us all.\n\nStudents are expected to go home and study these philosophers, and report their findings back to their teachers."

 russia.1017.t:0 "Anti-War Protests"
 russia.1017.desc:0 "In response to our intervention in Crimea, many liberal Russians have taken to the street in protest. So far, their movement is contained to the streets of Moscow, but there are no signs of the protests slowing down."
 russia.1017.a:0 "Ok"

 russia.1018.t:0 "The March Of Peace"
 russia.1018.desc:0 "Today, anti-war politicians and organisers held their largest protest so far - the so-called 'march of peace'. In attendance were some of the most vocal of Russia's opposition, notably Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny, as well as some estimated 20,000 other protestors.\n\nMembers of the Duma have gone on fiery rampages against these 'traitors to the motherland', and tensions within Russia only seem to be growing."
 russia.1018.a:0 "Hopefully this will be over soon"

 russia.1019.t:0 "Protests Escalate"
 russia.1019.desc:0 "Emboldened by our government's failures in Crimea, the protests have swelled to never before seen heights. Over a hundred thousand people have demonstrated against our government's actions in Moscow, and thousands more have held smaller protests in the countryside.\n\nThe situation is deteriorating rapidly, and only extreme measures can help us now."

 russia.1020.t:0 "Protests Disperse"

 russia.1021.t:0 "Vladimir Putin Assassinated!"
 russia.1021.desc:0 "Unable to get his opinions across to the crowds in an orderly manner, Putin eventually called upon the police to disperse the crowds. However, this ended up being his greatest, and final, mistake. While trying to leave the stadium, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was shot three times by an anti-war protestor. After being rushed to the hospital, he was pronounced dead at [?global.date.GetDateString].\n\nIn his place, the Security Council of the Russian Federation has taken over official control of the country, as the world watches to see what comes next."

 russia.1023.desc:0 "Nicknamed the 'Kinder Surprise' back in the nineties, former prime minister Sergey Kiriyenko has been winning over Putin's ear. As well as this, many institutes linked to him have been producing more and more regional administrators, growing his connections to all factions of the Russian elite.\n\nHowever, Kiriyenko's meteoric growth in recent years has not gone unnoticed. Several people in Putin's inner circle are demanding that he puts Kiriyenko in his place, and view him as a direct threat to their power."

 russia.1024.desc:0 "Over the past several weeks, defence minister Sergei Shoigu has been investigated by Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, where they have linked his daughter's name to an 18 million dollar mansion in the outskirts of Moscow. This has caused many to speculate that Putin want him gone, as Shoigu's predecessor Anatoly Serdyukov was dismissed and investigated over a similar corruption scandal in 2012."
 russia.1024.a:0 "Let's sweep this under the rug"
 russia.1024.b:0 "He needs to be punished for this"

 russia.1025.t:0 "Moscow Seeks To Strengthen The Union State"
 russia.1025.desc:0 "Since the Union State Treaty on the 8th of December 1999, ties have grown between ourselves and Russia. However, many in Moscow are growing dissatisfied with our supposed feet dragging at the negotiations. This narrative fools nobody. It is clear that Russia seeks to annex us outright, or at the very least force us to be entirely dependent on their good graces."
 russia.1025.a:0 "Oh well, it was inevitable"
 russia.1025.b:0 "Perhaps  a closer relationship should suffice"

 russia.1027.a:0 "What took so long?"

 russia.1028.t:0 "Belarus Leaves The CSTO!"
 russia.1028.desc:0 "It would seem our peaceful envoy to Belarus has rubbed them the wrong way. Believing us to try to be annexing them, Belarussian leader [BLR.GetLeader] has announced that his country will leave the CSTO and Union State Treaty effective immediately."
 russia.1028.a:0 "Who does that potato farmer think he is!"
 russia.1028.b:0 "Oh well."

 russia.1029.t:0 "Start Of The World Cup"
 russia.1029.desc:0 "Today, the World Cup has now officially kicked off in Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow. Thousands of fans have flocked from all over the world to see their teams play, and the Russian economy is booming because of it.\n\nIn the first game of the tournament, Russia thrashed Saudi Arabia 5-0, and Russia has been overcome with a sense of patriotism and joy."
 russia.1029.a:0 "May the best team win!"

 russia.1030.t:0 "Raise The Retirement Age?"
 russia.1030.desc:0 "With support for Putin at an all-time high, and the nation's attention focused on the world cup, it has been suggested in the Duma that the retirement age substantially - from 60 to 65 for men, and 55 to 63 for women. This would be controversial for a multitude of reasons, such as Putin's repeated promises not to raise the retirement age during his term, the substantial increase all at once, and most importantly - the fact that many poor Russians will die before they reach this new retirement age.\n\nHowever, it is known to all that not implementing the reforms will only lead to more economic woes at a time when the economy is far from stable, and will likely lead to a large economic collapse not too long in the future. Furthermore, we would avoid any immediate protests, as public demonstrations are currently banned in Russia due to the ongoing world cup.\n\nLike most decisions in Russia, the choice comes down to Putin."
 russia.1030.a:0 "Implement the reforms."
 russia.1030.b:0 "It is a problem for tomorrow’s leaders, not us"

 russia.1031.t:0 "Protests In Hyde Park"
 russia.1031.desc:0 "In response to our unpopular pension reforms, thousands of ordinary Russians have come out in protest. However, it is too late for many of them. Due to not being able to protest in the immediate aftermath of the announcement due to the ban on protests during the world cup, the protests are less severe than expected, although still not insignificant.\n\nDue to the pension reforms, as well as the perception of misusing the world cup to prevent protests, the approval rating of all members of government, including Putin, has plummeted."
 russia.1031.a:0 "Can't they see it was necessary?"

 russia.1032.t:0 "Patriot PMC Formed"
 russia.1032.desc:0 "Over the past decades, global wars have been dominated by the need for plausible deniability, and as such the world has seen an exponential rise in PMC activity. The Americans have Blackwater, the Brits have Aegis, the Germans have Asgaard, and we have Wagner. In order to capitalise on this growth, Sergey Shoigu has been involved in the founding of 'Patriot PMC', an they have already received contracts in Syria due to Shoigu's top position within the military."
 russia.1032.a:0 "War is just another market"

 russia.1033.t:0 "Continued Stagnation"
 russia.1033.desc:0 "Despite our government's best attempts, we have not been able to fully recover from the west's sanctions imposed on us. Our GDP remains low, and wealth inequality has only gone up. This has only exacerbated our country's brain drain, leaving us with a bleak future."

 russia.1034.t:0 "Issues With The Oligarchy"
 russia.1034.desc:0 "In a surprise to no-one, our government's heavy-handed measures in dealing with protests and opposition has lead to a sharp decline in organised resistance to our regime. An unfortunate result of this, at least for ordinary Russians, is that it is increasingly harder to combat the oligarchs, leaving said oligarchs with more power than ever before under Putin's regime."
 russia.1034.a:0 "Oh well"

 russia.1035.t:0 "Head Of The Conspiracy"
 russia.1035.desc:0 "For decades, Putin has been using the security apparatus to maintain his power within the country, but his grip weakening. Many people in Russian society want to see the current regime gone, so action must be taken to secure our control, with or without Putin. However, there is considerable debate over who the leader of our coup should be."

 russia.1038.t:0 "Putin Empowers Technocrats"
 russia.1038.desc:0 "Likely distrusting parts of his old guard, Vladimir Putin has been listening more and more to people belonging to the more reformist 'technocrat' faction.

 russia.1039.desc:0 "As part of our special military operation, our elite forces went into Kiev ahead of our main army, tasked with killing Ukrainian President [UKR.GetLeader], with which they have succeeded. Ukrainian morale is low, and government infighting only helps our troops on the ground."

 russia.1040.t:0 "The Fate Of Ukraine"
 russia.1040.desc:0 "With victory imminent, the question of how to administer Ukraine has come up. In the halls of the Kremlin there are two main factions.\n\nOne side argues that it should be directly incorporated into Russia, as doing so would help eliminate the notions of Ukraine being a separate state from Russia, as well as appease nationalist factions within our government. Doing this would likely help in administrating it, as it would allow our internal security forces to have greater control over the territory than they would if it were a seperate country, although it would make us even more unpopular with the west.\n\nThe other faction suggests installing a puppet regime in Kiev, arguing that it would give legitimacy to our claims of 'respecting our brother nation', as well as reduce overall opposition."

 russia.1042.desc:0 "After the mobilisation, Russia has been swept by protests even more extensive than those that happened at the start of the SMO. But that is not what keeps [ROOT.GetLeader] up at night.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Russians, mostly young men, have fled the country, mostly for Kazakhstan, Turkey and Georgia. Given that these men are some of Russia's most productive, it would seems that the mobilisation has not gone to plan in the slightest."

 russia.1044.desc:0 "Despite global media coverage of the build up of our troops on the Ukrainian border over for the solid part of a year, we continued to insist that they were simple troop exercises to the world, and to our troops. This was to maintain secrecy about our true intentions, but this approach has backfired horrendously.\n\nWhile stationed in Belarus, many of our troops sold off vital equipment and supplies, and were given only a day or two's notice about the invasion, too little to undo the damage. As a result, our northern thrust has spluttered and ground to a halt."

 russia.1047.desc:0 "Today, the office of the president of Russia has put out a new essay written by Vladimir Putin, titles 'On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians'. In the essay, Putin claims that the fates of Russians and Ukrainians are interlocked, as we are but one people. Putin also brings into question Ukraine's sovereignty, and 'right to exist as a nation', as he sees Ukraine as and artificial creation of the Bolsheviks. He also claims that the government of Ukraine is one of globalist Banderites, who oppress the ethnic Russians in the east as part of a 'western anti-Russia project'. As such, he ends the essay with highlighting how it is not only a right, but a necessity for Russia to interfere, and perhaps intervene directly in Ukrainian affairs, and to take what is rightfully ours."

 russia.1048.t:0 "Western Sanctions"
 russia.1048.desc:0 "As a response to our invasion of 'sovereign' Ukraine, the west has imposed sanctions on Russia, notably disconnecting us from SWIFT and cracking down on our ability to import certain goods for the production of arms.

Half of Russia's already middling GDP is stored outside of the country, and what remains inside is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy and powerful men. About a fifth of all Russians live under the poverty line, and many of the rural areas are without proper water, sewage and heating systems.
