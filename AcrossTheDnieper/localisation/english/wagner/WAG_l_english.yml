 wagner.2.t:0 "Wagner PMC Contract"
 wagner.2.d:0 "In Syria, our newly formed PMC gains the chance to show not only on paper, but in action the professionalism and uniqueness of our troops. We will participate in combat operations on the side of government forces, supporting them in their fight against opposition forces and terrorist groups. The company will also provide advisory and combat assistance, showing the great military tacticians that we have acquired in such short period to the Syrian army and also ensure the security of Russian facilities and personnel in Syria. We are also yet to take part in the protection of oil facilities in Syria, defending them against terrorist attacks and smugglers. In addition, our orchestra collects intelligence information and conducts special operations. If we do this right then theres no doubt that seeing our great results during the first deployment on the battlefield with the low amount of men and the freshness of our, Vladimir Vladimirovich will be very interested in financing the project further and giving us more opportunities and firepower."
