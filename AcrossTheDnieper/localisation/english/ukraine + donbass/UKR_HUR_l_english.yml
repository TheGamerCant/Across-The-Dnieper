 #Descriptions
 HUR_TARGET_arsen_pavlov_desc_1:0 "Arsen 'Motorola' Pavlov, born 02/02/1983, is a Russian-born terrorist and head of the infamous 'Sparta' Battalion. According to him, our actions at Maidan motivated him to come to Ukraine to 'restore order' in 2014. He has beaten up innocents, executed prisoners and committed unspeakable horrors against the civilian population. Currently, he resides in [DON.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], planning his next crime against the Ukrainian state. It is our job to bring him to justice."

He has beaten up innocents, executed prisoners and committed unspeakable horrors against the civilian population. Currently, he resides in [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], with total immunity granted to him by the terroristic Russian government for his actions against the Ukrainian state. Since no-one else will, it is our job to bring him to justice."
 
  HUR_TARGET_mikhail_tolstykh_desc_1:0 "Mikhail 'Givi' Tolstykh, born 19/07/1980, is a Russian collaborator and the leader of the infamous 'Somalia Battalion'. Givi is as equally brutal as he is incompetent. He is no commander, no soldier, and never visits the frontlines unless a camera and security is present. But when a camera is present, his actions towards innocents and prisoners of war are brutal and clear violations of the Geneva conventions. He seems to believe that this bastardous lifestyle can carry on, protected by his masters in Moscow. But we do not care for the opinions of terrorists. He will be brought to justice."

He has since fled to [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he is granted refuge by the Russian government. He will find out the hard way that nowhere is too far for us to bring terrorists and war criminals to justice."
