 atd_poland.1.t:0 "Seven Years Of PO"
 atd_poland.1.desc:0 "Coming into power in 2007, Donald Tusk's Platforma Obywatelska was a party of dreams. Dreams of further EU integration, tax cuts and of joining the Euro were at the forefront of voter's minds during this time, and yet, it was not to last.\n\nFortunately for Poland, the EU sovereign debt crisis and 2008 global reccession had little effect on the Polish economy. At a time where all of Poland's neighbours were facing budget cuts and mass unemployments, Poland's economy only continued to grow, albeit at a pace less than which it could have been.\n\nDespite this, things are not looking too good for PO in the polls. As it stands, the election seems close between them and PiS, and the question on everybody's minds is - can they pull off a third?"
 atd_poland.1.a:0 "And here's to seven more!"

 atd_poland.2.t:0 "The Need For NATO"
 atd_poland.2.desc:0 "After seventy years of relative peace in Europe, we are once again threatened by Russia. They have taken overt military action against neighbouring Ukraine, and their propagandists openly make threats against our own country.\n\nWhile most in Poland acknowledge this as a threat to our nation by proxy, our next steps are up for much debate. Some believe that we should further align ourselves with NATO, and co-operate more closely with the Americans. Others, however, belive that NATO's lacking response to the Ukrainian crisis is a sign that NATO is brain-dead and does not care for European security, and that Poland should take matters into her own hands."
 atd_poland.2.a:0 "One for all and all for one!"

 POL_the_eagle_soars_event_tt:0 "§Y[ROOT.GetName]§! completes focus §YThe Eagle Soars§!\n\nTaking this option will give greater bonuses to domestic industry and manpower as well as making it easier for us to have a more agressive and hawkish foreign policy."

 atd_poland.3.t:0 "Reorganising The High Command"
 atd_poland.3.desc:0 "Entering into effect on the first of January, the Polish armed forces high command (The DOSZ) is to be split and reorganised into the Armed Forces Operational Command and the Armed Forces General Command.\n\nThese reforms come as Poland seeks to further reform her military into a NATO-standard army, moving away from the Warsaw Pact doctrine. The Armed Forces Operational Command is tasked with the development and testing of doctrine, ensuring inter-operability with fellow NATO states, and keeping the army organised in times of war.\n\nThe Armed Forces General Command is subordinate to the General Chief of Staff, allocating funds for the procurement and maintenance of equipment and ensuring the combat-readiness of our soldiers.\n\nAs with any large scale government reorganisation, however, this will take time. Military bureaucrats expect that it will take up to two years for the transformation to be fully complete, but it's benefits are set to be worth it."

 atd_poland.6.t:0 "The Women's Self-Defence Program"
 atd_poland.6.desc:0 "In what many are calling an attempt to increase patriotism, the Minstry of Defence has announced it's plans to start a "Women's self-defence program". This program is open to any able-bodied female over the age of 18 and teaches them, among other things, the techniques of how to defensive postures, how to break holds, and guards against kicks, strangulation and assaults with a weapon.\n\nThe program has been met with mixed reception, with Roman Polko saying it is would be a good way to spot potential recruits for the army and the territorial defence forces, but stated that "aikido and jujitsu won't win a war"."
 atd_poland.6.a:0 "An interesting initiative"

 atd_poland.7.t:0 "Missile Hits Polish Territories"
 atd_poland.7.desc:0 "As the war in Ukraine rages on, an explosion rocks the village of Przewodów, near the border with Ukraine, killing two Polish citizens. Initial reports suggest a stray missile may be responsible, sparking fears of escalation and drawing Poland deeper into the conflict."
 atd_poland.7.a:0 "We have to launch an investigation ASAP!"
 atd_poland.7.b:0 "How about we keep this under the radar, eh?"
