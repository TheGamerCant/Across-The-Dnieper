These people simply died, they are simply lying in the ground, they are simply killed. And there are many of them.

The events that take place over the coming months will influence Ukraine, and the world, for years to come."
 UKR_2022_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Over the past eight years, Ukraine has seen four presidents, a civil war, occupation by foreign powers and an economic and demographic crisis. Nobody knows what the future of Ukraine is, though all of the Russians on the border might have something to do with it..."

 BLR_2014_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The nation of Belarus stands at a crossroads. Sandwiched between Russia to the east and the European Union to the west, the country found itself at the center of a growing geopolitical struggle. And so, Belarus finds itself at a pivotal moment in its history. Will it continue to align itself with Russia, or will it forge a new path forward?"

 POL_2014_SCENARIO_DESC:0 ""
 POL_2022_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Poland has successfully pivoted itself towards the west. It's economy, infrastructure and political system surpassing many countries in the west, in one of the great success stories of decommunisation.

 ROM_2014_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "After the fall of communism, Romania has had a hard time transitioning to a capitalist and liberal system. Poor infrastructure, a lacking military and unstable politics have hindered Romania's progress. Elections are soon, who will the Romanian people choose to lead them through this tumultuous and transatory time?"
 ROM_2022_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "A series of successful reforms has made Romania a notable name when it comes to geopolitics. The PNL government has revitalised the agricultural sector, the economy, the infrastructure and notably the internal corruption situation has improved. But Russia is mobilising on the border of Ukraine, their eastern neighbour. The pieces are in place, but can Romania win this game?"

 DON_2022_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "Since the signing of Minsk II effectively brought an end to the hot phase of the Donbass war, the Donetsk People's Republic has been brought closer to Moscow.
